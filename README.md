# TTA-Python-Projects
This repo is for my Python Projects for the TTA boot camp. 
These projects cover include Django, SQL, and creating GUIs.
I am not the most fond of the front-end side of things but the website building through Django has given me a new perspective on it that I really appreciate. 
I think it's important to find ways to enjoy things you may nto like so much because there is so much to learn and it's easier to learn if you're interested. 
Creating GUIs was fascinating because I don't consider myself a very creative/expressive person, so I tend to not try to be visually creative. But creating GUIs, while I am far from mastering it, gives me an opportunity to create something visually that isn't affected by how well or poorly I can draw!

Some projects include:
- Phonebook & Student Tracking: GUIs that take and store information which can be retrieved.
- Checkbook & Django University: Using Django to create a UI on a site for users to store and retrieve data.
