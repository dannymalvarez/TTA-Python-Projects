# TTA-Python-Projects
This repo is for my Python Projects for the TTA boot camp. 
These projects cover include Django, SQL, and creating GUIs.

Creating GUIs was fascinating because I don't consider myself a very creative/expressive person, so I tend to not try to be visually creative. But creating GUIs, while I am far from mastering it, These projects have given me an opportunity to create something visually that isn't affected by how well or poorly I can draw!

Some projects include:
- Phonebook & Student Tracking: GUIs that take and store information which can be retrieved.
- Checkbook & Django University: Using Django to create a UI on a site for users to store and retrieve data.
